I am a doctoral candidate in the MIT mechanical engineering department where I am part of the Vortical Flow Research Lab advised by Professor Dick K.P. Yue. My graduate work in hydrodynamics has focused on ocean wave interactions with floating sea ice, specifically understanding the role of nonlinear wave-wave interactions in ice breakup and wave scattering by sea ice. My work seeks to address how large storm-generated waves cause large-scale ice breakup in the marginal ice zone (MIZ). I use theoretical analysis and develop computational tools to address these problems.

Before MIT, I studied naval architecture and marine engineering at Webb Institute where I participated in six ~2 month long internships in different facets of the maritime industry, including apprenticing at shipyards in Ketchikan, AK and Portsmouth, RI, sailing as an engineering cadet on an oil tanker between Long Beach, CA and Valdez, AK, and numerous R&D positions in hydrodynamics in Honolulu, Houston, and the Netherlands.
